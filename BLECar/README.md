# BLE Car
A radio controlled car modified to use be controlled with Bluetooth Low Energy. Arduino nano 33 BLE and the ArduinoBLE library to be specific.

## Original car
The original car was a toy. You could not controll the speed r steering, it was just max or nothing. The receiver consisted of a RF receiver and a motor driver/h-bridge called YX18181AM.

## Modified car
The new remote control is a web-app using the P5 ble library.

The reciever is a Arduino Nano 33 BLE, which replaces the old radio receiver. The traces are cut and the same inputs on the motor driver chip is used.
